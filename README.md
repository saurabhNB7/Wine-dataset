# Wine-dataset
This is the dataset that I have obtained from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains feature columns like volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar etc. and target column as quality. and I have tried to predict the quality of alcohol depending on above features.
